# Home Assistant Configuration

## Introduction

This is a store/backup of my second generation Home Assistant installation.

The system runs on a new Raspberry Pi 3 running on Stretch Lite and was set up in March 2018.

It is intended to be accesses in 3 ways

* The web interface
* Amazon Alexa
* Apple HomeKit

It replaces the first generation installation running on an older Pi and Home Assistant 0.57.2 which became too hard to update in situ.

## Change Log

* v0.0.1 April 1, 2018
  Clean install of Home Assistant 0.66.0
